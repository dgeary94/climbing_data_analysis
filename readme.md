# Climbing data analysis & predictions #

As a keen climber, I wanted to explore existing climbing related datasets and discover interesting insights while applying my data skills.

This notebook presents an exploratory data analysis of a sport climbing dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jordizar/climb-dataset/data) includes public logged data scraped from popular climbing website 8a.nu. 

In this notebook, a number of questions are posed and answered through analysis and visualisation. Pandas and numpy are used to process the data and visualisations are created using matplotlib and seaborn. At the end of the notebook is a bonus section which compares two common machine learning models to see if we can predict max climbing grade. The scikit-learn package is utilised for this.
